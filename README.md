# Titanic Data Analysis

This project showcases data cleaning, visualization, and basic analysis of the Titanic dataset using Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn).

## Overview

The dataset contains information about Titanic passengers, including age, gender, passenger class, fare, and survival outcome. The goal is to explore patterns that influenced survival.

## Steps Covered

- **Data Cleaning**
  - Filling missing Age values with the mean.
  - Replacing missing Embarked values with the most common port.
  - Marking missing Cabin entries as "Unknown".

- **Visualizations**
  - Age distribution histogram
  - Survival rates by gender
  - Survival rates by passenger class

- **Key Observations**
  - Most passengers were between 28 and 32 years old, with fewer older passengers.
  - Women had higher survival rates, reflecting rescue priorities.
  - First class passengers were more likely to survive compared to other classes.
